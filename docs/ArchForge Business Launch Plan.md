## 2. Branding, Logo, and Style Guide

**Aesthetic**: "ForgeFlow"—Clean, inspiring for AU SMBs (finance/dental/construction). Playful alchemy (Sutherland: Irrational delight via depth illusions) + psych (Cialdini scarcity/unity). Inspired by original StarAtlas.com (parallax "fly-in" scroll), Notion (modular), Canva (accessible AU vibe).  

**Psych Foundation**: Frame AI as low-risk "unlock" (Prospect Theory); Build unity via growth stories.  

### Logo Concept
- **Primary**: Anvil morphing into neural node; hammer sparks form vector path. Text: "Archforge" (Inter Bold, arched) + ".au" sparks.  
- **Variations**: Monochrome; Animated SVG (hover: Sparks "forge" tagline: "AI That Builds Your Empire").  
- **Rationale**: Anvil = trust; Sparks = joyful surprise.  
- **Colors**: #1A1A1A (black, 70%); #FF6B35 (orange sparks, 20%); #4A90E2 (blue vectors, 10%).  

*Note: Confirm for AI-generated logo mocks.*

### Style Guide

| Element | Guidelines | Examples/Inspirations | Psych Tie-In |
|---------|------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| **Typography** | Headings: Inter Bold (48px H1 arched). Body: Inter Regular. Playful: Spark Script for CTAs. | Notion + Star Atlas titles | Fluency builds trust; Arched flow = aspirational growth. |
| **Colors** | Black 70%, Orange 20% (urgency), Blue 10% (calm). Gradients: Black-to-orange glow. | Canva AU vibe | Orange primes excitement; Blue eases tech fears. |
| **Imagery/Graphics** | Hero: Parallax "forge journey" (fly through workshop: Anvil → AI → dashboard). Icons: Line tools. Photos: Relatable AU SMBs. | Star Atlas depth + Linear flows | Vivid visualization (Hormozi); Playful = effortless scale illusion. |
| **UI/UX** | Single-page scroll; Fly-in nav; Orange "Forge It" buttons (spark anim). Forms: Natural language. | Framer interactions | Nudge reduces friction; Reveals build reciprocity. |
| **Voice/Tone** | Inspiring: "Forge your future." Playful: "AI handles grunt—you dream." Clean: Facts ("40% faster Xero"). | Mailchimp witty/pro | Liking via AU banter; "Fun magic" vs. intimidating code. |

**Implementation**: Use Framer/Webflow for site (10-15 hours build).
