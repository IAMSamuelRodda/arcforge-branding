## Structure

### `case-study-arcforge/`

ArcForge-specific branding materials used as the case study for testing this branding automation tool:

- `design/` - Logo concepts, Midjourney prompts, brand design briefs
- `docs/` - ArcForge business strategy, brand guidelines, asset library
- `referances/` - Reference images and concepts
- `LOGO-GENERATION-NEXT-STEPS.md` - Logo generation workflow (completed)

**Purpose**: These materials are the **test case** for the branding automation system, not part of the core tool itself. The tool should work for ANY brand, not just ArcForge.

### `timing-calibration/`

AI agent velocity calibration research (Nov 2025):

- `AI-AGENT-TIMING-CALIBRATION.md` - Project-specific timing data
- `TIMING-CALIBRATION-SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary

**Status**: Methodology integrated into `github-project-setup` skill (v2.4.0, Section 8). These docs are kept for historical reference only.
