# Midjourney Prompts for ArchForge Logo

**Created:** November 6, 2025
**Based on:** Circuit forge concept (isometric cube + emerging circuit traces)

---

## Prompt Formula Best Practices

✅ **Include:** "vector logo", "minimalist", "solid background", designer references
✅ **Style keywords:** "simplified", "solid line", "geometric", "clean"
✅ **Keep under 40 words** for best results
✅ **Single color preferred** (add "black and white logo" or "monochromatic")
❌ **Avoid:** Trying to include text/wordmark in the generation (add separately)

## Primary Prompts (Circuit Forge Concept)

### Prompt 1: Minimal Circuit Forge
```

## Alternative Directions (If Circuit Concept Doesn't Work)

### Prompt 5: Geometric Arch (Architectural)
```
minimalist vector logo, geometric arch symbol, continuous bold line, architectural precision, black monochromatic, solid white background, Massimo Vignelli style, clean modern --v 6 --s 250
```

**Keywords:** arch, continuous line, architectural
**Best for:** "Arch" in ArchForge literal reference

---

### Prompt 6: Keystone Symbol
```
vector logo, geometric keystone trapezoid shape with foundation arch, minimalist black lines, solid background, architectural symbol, Paul Rand simplicity, modern emblem --v 6 --s 250
```

**Keywords:** keystone, trapezoid, foundation
**Best for:** Architectural metaphor (you're the keystone)

---

### Prompt 7: Abstract Data Transformation
```
minimalist logo design, scattered elements converging into structured geometric shape, clean lines, monochrome black, white background, order from chaos visual, simplified modern --v 6 --s 250
```

**Keywords:** scattered to structured, chaos to order
**Best for:** Transformation theme (might be too complex for Midjourney)

---

## Advanced Variations (Adding Color)

### Prompt 8: Orange Accent Version
```
geometric tech logo, isometric cube with circuit traces, minimal design, black primary with orange accent highlights, solid white background, vector flat colors, clean modern --v 6 --s 250
```

**Color:** Black + Orange (#FF6B35)
**Note:** Add "flat colors" to avoid gradients

---

### Prompt 9: Blue Tech Version
```
minimalist vector logo, circuit board cube symbol with nodes, geometric precision, monochromatic blue (#4A90E2), solid background, tech emblem, Vignelli minimalism --v 6 --s 250
```

**Color:** Vector Blue (#4A90E2)
**Best for:** Alternative color treatment

## Tips for Using These Prompts

### 1. Start with Primary Prompts 1-4
These are closest to your circuit forge concept. Generate 4 variations of each using Midjourney's `/imagine` command.

### 2. Iteration Strategy
- If results are too complex: Add "ultra minimal", "simplified", "fewer elements"
- If results are too simple: Remove "minimal", add "detailed linework"
- If not geometric enough: Add "precise geometry", "technical drawing"
- If too technical: Add "elegant", "modern", "friendly"

### 3. Midjourney Parameters
- `--v 6` = Version 6 (latest, best for logos)
- `--s 250` = Stylization 250 (balanced, not too artistic)
- Add `--style raw` for more literal interpretation
- Add `--no text, letters, words` to avoid unwanted text

### 4. Remix Winning Concepts
Once you find a direction you like, use `/imagine` again with variations:
- Change "3 circuit pathways" to "5 circuit pathways"
- Modify "isometric cube" to "geometric cube" or "3D box"
- Adjust "nodes" to "circuit nodes" or "connection points"

### 5. Post-Processing
Remember: Midjourney outputs will need refinement in vector software (Adobe Illustrator, Figma) for:
- Perfect geometric precision
- Exact color matching to brand palette
- Scaling optimization
- Adding wordmark separately

## Designer Style References

Use these in prompts for specific aesthetics:

- **Massimo Vignelli** - Timeless minimalism, geometric precision, grid-based
- **Paul Rand** - Bold simplicity, clever symbols, playful geometry
- **Saul Bass** - Bold graphics, dynamic shapes, kinetic energy
- **Michael Bierut** - Modern precision, intelligent simplicity
- **Milton Glaser** - Iconic shapes, clever visual metaphors

## Brand Context (For Reference)

**ArchForge Core Concept:**
- Transforms business chaos into organized systems
- AI-powered efficiency for Australian SMBs
- Builds architectural solutions from scattered data

**Visual Metaphors:**
- Foundation (cube/base) → Established business structure
- Emerging circuits → AI transformation/intelligence being built
- Nodes → Data points, connections, network
- Upward growth → Building, forging, creating

**Brand Colors:**
- Primary: Forge Black (#1A1A1A)
- Accent 1: Spark Orange (#FF6B35) - transformation energy
- Accent 2: Vector Blue (#4A90E2) - intelligence, trust

**Aesthetic Goals:**
- Clean and simple (not chaotic)
- Minimalist geometric (Stripe/Figma level)
- Tech + Architecture fusion
- Scalable (works at 16px and 16ft)

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Generate Initial Batch** (Start here)
   - Run Prompts 1-4 in Midjourney
   - Generate 4 variations of each (16 total options)
   - Save all to compare

2. **First Filter**
   - Select top 3-5 that capture the concept
   - Note what works and what doesn't

3. **Refinement Round**
   - Remix winning prompts with adjustments
   - Try adding/removing elements
   - Test color variations (Prompts 8-9)

4. **Final Selection**
   - Choose 1-2 final directions
   - Upscale to highest resolution
   - Export for vector tracing

5. **Vector Refinement**
   - Import to Illustrator/Figma
   - Trace/recreate with perfect geometry
   - Apply exact brand colors
   - Create variations (icon-only, horizontal, stacked)

## Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue:** Results too abstract/artistic
**Fix:** Add "--style raw" parameter, emphasize "vector logo", "clean lines"

**Issue:** Too many elements/busy
**Fix:** Add "ultra minimal", "3 elements maximum", "simplified"

**Issue:** Wrong perspective on cube
**Fix:** Specify "front-facing isometric" or "30-degree angle isometric"

**Issue:** Colors not matching brand
**Fix:** Generate in black/white, add color in post-processing for precision

**Issue:** Text appearing in logo
**Fix:** Add "--no text, letters, words, typography" to prompt

## Next Steps After Midjourney

Once you have winning concepts from Midjourney:

1. **Vector Conversion** - Trace in Illustrator or use vector auto-trace
2. **Geometric Precision** - Adjust to perfect angles, spacing, proportions
3. **Color Application** - Apply exact brand colors (#1A1A1A, #FF6B35, #4A90E2)
4. **Wordmark Design** - Design "ARCHFORGE" typography separately
5. **Lockup Creation** - Combine symbol + wordmark in multiple configurations
6. **Export Production Files** - SVG, PNG (multiple sizes), favicon, etc.

I can help with all of these post-processing steps once you have the Midjourney outputs!
