## ITERATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Match Reference (Start Here!)
1. Use **Prompt 1A** (Direct Reference Match)
2. Generate 4 variations (V1-V4 in Midjourney)
3. Pick the one closest to reference image

### Phase 2: Refine Details
1. If anvil waist not curved enough → Use "Emphasize Curved Waist" prompt
2. If circuits too simple → Use "Emphasize Circuit Detail" prompt
3. If elements unbalanced → Use "Balanced Elements" prompt

### Phase 3: Try Alternatives
1. Test **Prompt 1B-1D** for different style interpretations
2. Compare which designer style (Vignelli, Paul Rand) works best
3. Try outlined vs solid fill versions

### Phase 4: Adjust Complexity
1. Too busy? → Try **Prompt 2A** (Simplified)
2. Too simple? → Try **Prompt 2B** (More Complex)
3. Too rigid? → Try **Prompt 2C** (Asymmetric)

### Phase 5: Add Color
1. Once you have winning B&W version
2. Apply **Prompts 3A-3C** for brand colors
3. Test which color treatment works best

## KEY TERMS FOR REFERENCE IMAGE MATCH

**Must include these keywords:**
- ✅ "curved hourglass waist" or "pinched waist"
- ✅ "angular branches" or "90-degree branches" or "right-angle branches"
- ✅ "hollow nodes" or "donut nodes" or "circular nodes with holes"
- ✅ "isometric view" or "isometric perspective"
- ✅ "wide top platform" (optional but helps)

**Avoid these terms (they lead away from reference):**
- ❌ "organic curves" (branches should be angular)
- ❌ "flowing" (circuits are geometric)
- ❌ "solid nodes" (they're hollow in reference)
- ❌ "tapered anvil" (it's hourglass, not tapered)

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue:** Anvil waist not curved enough (looks like straight box)
**Fix:** Add "pronounced curved hourglass waist", "pinched middle section"

**Issue:** Circuit branches too curvy/organic
**Fix:** Add "angular branches", "90-degree angles", "PCB-style right angles"

**Issue:** Nodes are solid circles (not hollow)
**Fix:** Add "hollow circular nodes", "donut nodes", "nodes with white centers"

**Issue:** Perspective wrong (not isometric)
**Fix:** Add "isometric technical view", "30-degree isometric angle"

**Issue:** Too complex/detailed
**Fix:** Add "ultra minimal", "simplified", "clean lines only"

**Issue:** Not enough like reference
**Fix:** Use Prompt 1A with "--style raw" flag for more literal interpretation

## RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Generate Reference Match
```
minimalist vector logo, isometric anvil with curved hourglass waist and wide top platform, 3 circuit board traces emerging with angular branches, circular hollow nodes, clean black lines, white background, technical precision, geometric symbol --v 6 --s 250 --style raw

**Circuits need work?**
→ Use "Emphasize Circuit Detail" prompt

**Both need work?**
→ Use "More Anvil Detail" prompt

### Step 3: Try Style Variations
→ Test Prompts 1B (Technical), 1C (Bold), 1D (Paul Rand)

### Step 4: Perfect the Winner
→ Adjust element count (2A-2D) if needed

### Step 5: Add Brand Colors
→ Apply color variations (3A-3C)

### Step 6: Share with me!
→ I'll help refine to production SVG/PNG
