# Websites That Inspire
## Site 1

The way this site takes you on a journey as you scoll. Its visually stunning, as it should be. It showcases what he does without you, the user, realising your are getting taken on a journey as you scoll. The way the section 002 Skills is displayed begins a side scroll which contrasts the previous veritcal motion to change the way the brain thinks. It engages you to look, and then he shows you the process he is using. See the image site_1_1.png in referance images.

## Site 2

I like the flow of this site. Noting that in some ways, they are a compeditor to what I am doing. Though, not directly. They are focusing on poeple making their own apps. Many people wont want to do that, nor manage that. In the short term, I can, and in the long term, we can niche down. But the design of the sigh with this animations and graphcis feels good, somehow. 

## Site 3

I like the brand design for this. The simple name. The aligning the brand name with cosmic theme and images.
